- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @behhhoui
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: using data to learn more about or solve practical global issues (food waste, health, global warming, etc)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: improving my Python/ coding skills, and deploying ML models into production (how do I get it out of just a Jupyter notebook?)
